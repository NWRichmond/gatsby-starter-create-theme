# Gatsby Starter Create Theme

This Gatsby starter helps you scaffold a [Gatsby theme ](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes) connected to an example project.

This starter is inspired by [gatsby-starter-theme-workspace](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-theme-workspace), which uses [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) to connect your theme to an example project. So what's the difference? Instead of Yarn workspaces, this starter uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).
